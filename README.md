# React Hooks

- Normal JS utility functions
- Some important react hooks
  useState()
  useEffect()

## `useState()`

`useState()` is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage state. Whenever a state variable updates, React triggers a reconciliation cycle, leading to the re-rendering of the component.

## `useEffect()`

`useEffect()` is another React Hook used for handling side effects in functional components. Its behavior varies based on the presence or absence of a dependency array.

- If **no dependency array** is provided, `useEffect` is called on every render.
- If the **dependency array is empty**, `useEffect` is called only on the initial render (just once).
- If the **dependency array is not empty**, `useEffect` is called every time the dependency array changes.
