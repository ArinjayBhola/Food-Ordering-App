# Namaste React 🚀

# Food Ordering App

This is a fascinating project – a food ordering app using the power duo of React.js and Tailwind CSS, with thorough testing using Jest, and real-time data from the Swiggy live API. 🍔🛵

# Technology Stack:

🌐 Replicating Swiggy: We meticulously recreated the user interface and functionalities of Swiggy, with real-time data from their live API, ensuring an authentic user experience.

⚙️ React.js Magic: Leveraging the flexibility and reactivity of React.js, we ensured a seamless and responsive user experience, all while handling live data updates.

💅 Tailwind CSS Styling: Tailwind CSS helped us keep the styling process smooth and efficient, with its utility-first approach and responsive design.

🧪 Jest Testing: Quality assurance was a top priority. We used Jest for comprehensive testing, covering everything from unit tests to end-to-end testing, ensuring our clone with live data remains robust.

💡 Learning Experience: Building this clone was not only a great technical challenge but also a fantastic opportunity for learning about working with live APIs and understanding how a platform like Swiggy operates.
